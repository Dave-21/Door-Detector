"# Door-Detector" 

The file you want to use is "main.pyw".
The "main.pyw" is connecting to "com5" so change
it to the COM port your Arduino is on.

Plug in your Arduio(I used Uno), make sure it has
the "DorOpen.ino" uploaded onto it, and open
the "main.pyw". It won't open a terminal or show
up in your task bar; it runs in the background
