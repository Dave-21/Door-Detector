"# Door-Detector" 

The file you want to use is "main.pyw".
The "main.pyw" is connecting to "com5" so change
it to the COM port your Arduino is on.

Plug in your Arduio(I used Uno), make sure it has
the "DorOpen.ino" uploaded onto it, and open
the "main.pyw". It won't open a terminal or show
up in your task bar; it runs in the background.

The Diagram is in the photo above. It doesn't
matter which way you put the wires, as long
as one is plugged into one of the "gnd" and
the other into 11, and that you have something
metal(like a piece of foil) that touches both
wires together when the door is shut.
